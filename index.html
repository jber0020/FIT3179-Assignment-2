                    The grass is always greener elsewhere. But where is it greenest? We will set out on a journey to work towards an answer to that question. Though what country will be best to
                    live in will likely depend on the individual, there are a few key factors that will impact every individual. How much to weigh these factors against each other is up to you
                    to determine, so what we're going to do is look at each in a vaccuum. This won't be an exhaustive list of factors, but hopefully we will make a good start in determining where
                    you could set up your perfect life!

                    The first and most obvious factor to look at it, what will your quality of life be? Luckily, there are people over at <a href="https://www.numbeo.com">numbeo.com</a> who have done all
                    the work for us! They've calculated a quality of life index for most countries in the world, which I've conveniently embedded in the map above.

                <p>
                    The quality of life index is calculated by combining other indices that may impact an individual's life in that country, including the purchasing power index, pollution index, 
                    house price to income ratio, cost of living index, safety index, health care index, traffic commute index, and climate index.

                <p>
                    That's a lot of indices! So it seems the quality of life index covers a lot of factors by itself, and so if you're looking to speedrun your decision you could stop here. Feel free to interact with the map
                    above to investigate the countries your considering before moving on.

                    Next up, we'll consider how happy the people are in each country. To do this, we'll take a look at the data from the 2020 <a href="https://worldhappiness.report">World Happines Report</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The World Happiness Report collects survey data from over 150 countries worldwide, which reports how people evaluate their own lives. Based on these surveys, each countries is then
                    given a score. To the left, you can see the top 10 happiest countries in the world! If you are interested in specific regions, you can filter for the top 10 in a given region (or 
                    if a country has less than 10 countries, you'll see all of the countries).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can see that Finland takes the crown as the happiest country on Earth, followed by many other European countries. In fact, New Zealand is the only non-European country
                    that has found itself in the top 10. Maybe we have something to learn from each of these countries?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now it should go without saying that how happy you will be living in these countries will not perfectly correlated with scores in this report.
                    However, it should give you some indication as to which countries foster environments for happier lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now if you're ready to move on, we're going to be looking at life expectancy next!

                    Life expectancy is a pretty straightforward factor to explain. It's simply the average lifespan of the individuals living in a given country.
                    So if you're looking to live a long life, perhaps Hong Kong should be taken into consideration, as it has the highest life expectancy at an age of 85 years and almost 5 months!

                    We see a few countries from eastern Asia populating the high end of a chart, including Macao, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. We also see Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, and even
                    my home of Australia up there! In these countries, you can expect to live in conditions that allow for a longer and healthier life.

                    Now we'll look at how your financial situation will likely be in each of the countries you're considering. And so, we'll be looking at the cost of living. But of course,
                    it doesn't make sense to consider cost of living without considering the median income.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Cost of Living Index was calculated by <a href="https://www.numbeo.com">numbeo.com</a>, and is calculated in comparison to the cost of living in New York City (NYC), USA.
                    An index of 100 indicates that the cost of living is roughly the same of that in NYC, whereas an index of 120 indicates that a country's cost of living is about 20% more than
                    that of NYC. The factors in calculating this index include a groceries index, a restaurants index, and a local purchasing power index.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The median income is a metric used to calculate the midpoint of a country's income distribution. Half of a contry's population earns more than the median income, and half earns
                    less. The median statistic is more resistant to outliers than the mean, and so we've opted to use median income instead of a mean statistic such as GDP as this will more accurately
                    describe the conditions of the general population. It is important to note that the median income is calculated in a theoretical "international dollar" currency, which is not
                    equivalent to any real world currency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the right I've plotted various countries on a graph to represent both of these statistics. Hover over a point to discover which country it is!

                    It is important that as a citizen of a country, you have a say in the decisions that matter. It is well known that democracy is an important part of civilisation, and so 
                    I've plotted the 10 most egalitarian democratic countries in 2021, and their given indices over the years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The democratic index (sourced from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democracy">ourworldindata.org</a>) is calculated based on the expert assessments by V-Dem.
                    It takes into account voting rights, freedom and fairness of elections, freedoms of association and expression, as well as the extent to which the protection of rights, 
                    access to power, and distribution of resources is equal. It is on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 best least democratic and 1 being most democratic.
                </p>
                <p>
                   If you're having a hard time reading the chart, you can select a country in the legend to highlight it on the chart. If you wish to see what these values were further in 
                   past, using the "Min. Year" selecter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On our chart we see that Denmark has taken 1st place in 2021, followed by Norway, then Sweden. If you want your voice to be heard, maybe consider one of these countries.
